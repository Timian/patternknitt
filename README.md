============

Pattern making to knitting purposes

Dependencies: You need to have python 2.7.6, and kivy to run it.

How it should work when finish
in the settings part that will open with the chooes pattern making, there you should write the color code you have choosen, knitting pin size, number of masks, and otther relevant information.
it should give three choices to how you can make the knitting pattern
1. text based, here you should mark different settings to the pattern, and a text field in the bottom there you can wirte down the pattern you are going to make.
2. pattern based, here you should fill inn the setting as asked above, and in the button instead of a text field it will be a routed field there you can mark out your own pattern
3. both text and pattern based, the settings are as mention above, but instead of just one field there are now two fields one text based and one routed field.

in the future it should have camre support so you can knitt what you take picture of. Also have support for crochet
